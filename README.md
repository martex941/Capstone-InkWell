## **What is InkWell?**

InkWell is a website for writers to write and collaborate on their projects. It features a rich text editor using [Django Quill by LeeHanYeong](https://github.com/LeeHanYeong/django-quill-editor). My idea behind it was a basic version of GitHub but for people who write books or short stories. 


### **Important things to install:**
- [django-quill-editor](https://pypi.org/project/django-quill-editor/)
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)


# **Overview**

## **1. Writing**

### 1.1 Text Editor
InkWell utilizes [Django Quill](https://github.com/LeeHanYeong/django-quill-editor) to let writers express themselves in various ways. Simplicity, however, is the name of the game as the idea for the website is to bring the "retro" style into light.
