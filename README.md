## **What is InkWell?**

InkWell is a website for writers to write and collaborate on their projects. It features a rich text editor using [Django Quill by LeeHanYeong](https://github.com/LeeHanYeong/django-quill-editor). My idea behind it was a basic version of GitHub but for people who write books or short stories. 


### **Important things to install:**
- [django-quill-editor](https://pypi.org/project/django-quill-editor/)
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
